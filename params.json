{"name":"The Future of Music","tagline":"Data Science - CS109 Project","body":"### Where it all began\r\n\r\n<img src=\"images/intro_image.jpg\" alt=\"intro_image\" class=\"inline\"/>\r\n\r\nMusic is a huge part of our lives - from popular radio stations to our favorite artists, listening to music has not only become a source of relaxation and pleasure but a passion. We wanted to explore this area and dissect what makes some music, songs/artists more popular than others, to be able to predict the popularity of a song. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"images/echonestlogo.png\" alt=\"echonestlogo\" class=\"inline\"/>\r\n\r\nThe source of our data is an API service called Echo Nest. They provide a wide coverage of data on detailed song information from millions of artists. Because of the diverse feature set they provide, we decided their data would best suit our inquiry as to what aspects of songs most strongly affect their popularity. \r\n\r\n### Project Goals\r\n\r\nWe wanted to be able to predict the popularity of a song from its intrinsic aspects - that is, are songs with fast tempos more likely to be popular? Put together, do all these \"popularity-inducing\" aspects of a song make a song popular? Or is there something more in the picture? \r\n\r\nTo that end, we assessed our performance by whether or not we could predict whether a song made it to the Billboard Top 100. To that end, we wanted to measure how features such as tempo, song length, lyrics, genre, energy, and much more contributed to popularity on a national level. \r\n\r\n### Initial Modelling\r\n\r\nTODO: Talk about Ridge Regression\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we attempted a Linear SVM. Unfortunately, as we noted from doing pre-analysis visualization of the song features, our features aren't easily linearly separable; what this entails is that finding a decision boundary by which to distinguish songs in the top 100 from songs not in the top 100\r\n\r\nTODO: Talk about Random Forest\r\n\r\n### Adding Lyrics to the Equation\r\n\r\nTODO: Talk about Lyrics\r\n\r\n### Advanced Modeling\r\n\r\nTODO: Do we even have these?\r\n\r\n### Our Results\r\n\r\nTODO: list our conclusions\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you have questions or concerns, please message Allen Chen (@allenchen248), Richard Wang (lmetatron), or Jesse Chen (@chenje16).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
