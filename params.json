We wanted to explore this area and dissect what makes some music, songs/artists more popular than others, to be able to predict the popularity of a song. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"images/echonestlogo.png\" alt=\"echonestlogo\" class=\"inline\"/>\r\n\r\nThe source of our data is an API service called Echo Nest. They provide a wide coverage of data on detailed song information from millions of artists. Because of the diverse feature set they provide, we decided their data would best suit our inquiry as to what aspects of songs most strongly affect their popularity. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you have questions or concerns, please message Allen Chen (@allenchen248), Richard Wang (lmetatron), or Jesse Chen (@chenje16).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
